# 🌌 Digital Hub

My personal ecosystem for engineering and creative exploration.

## 🏗️ Architecture
- **[Frontend](#angular-frontend):** Angular (The "Interface")
- **[Primary API](#nodejs-primary-api):** Node.js (Project & Career logic)
- **[Secondary API](#ruby-on-rails-secondary-api):** Ruby on Rails (Creative Corner & Blog logic)
- **[CMS](#headless-wordpress-cms):** Headless WordPress
- **[Orchestration](#docker-orchestration):** Docker
- **[Infrastructure](#digitalocean-infrastructure):** DigitalOcean

## 🛠️ Technology Deep Dive

### Angular (Frontend)
- **Implementation:**
- **Role:** The user-facing interface. Acts as the unified glass pane that aggregates data from multiple backends, providing a seamless, fast, and interactive experience for visitors. 

### Node.js (Primary API)
- **Implementation:**
- **Role:** The project engine. Manages dynamic data related to my engineering career, such as project matadata, resume details, and the logic for the contact form and email integration. 

### Ruby on Rails (Secondary API)
- **Implementation:** API-only Rails mode utilizing Active Record for database ORM and the MVC (Model-View-Controller) design pattern. 
- **Role:** The creative API. Serves content-rich data for the photography and music sections, showcasing my ability to work across different programming paradigms. 

### Headless WordPress (CMS)
- **Implementation:** WordPress REST API integration.
- **Role:** The content source. Allows me to use a professional writing interface for my blog without the performance overhead of a traditional WordPress frontend, proving my ability to decouple content from code. 

### Docker (Orchestration)
- **Implementation:** Multi-stage Dockerfiles and Docker Compose.
- **Role:** The environment standardizer. Orchestrates the entire ecosystem into isolated environments. It ensures that the "Digital Hub" runs identically on my local machine and the production server.

### DigitalOcean (Infrastructure)
- **Implementation:** Linux Droplet (Ubuntu) + Nginx Reverse Proxy.
- **Role:** The production host. Acts as the production host for the Hub. I manage the server via SSH, configuring Nginx to route traffic to the appropriate containers (Angular, Node, or Rails) while managing SSL certificates and system security.
